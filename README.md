## Overview

This is the first challenge from the "Building Responsive Layouts" learning path. It features a clean, modern design with a subtle, minimalist animation on the CTA button.

The design encourages a focus on responsiveness, with the component optimized for both mobile and desktop.

Overall, it's a good project and a great opportunity to learn.
